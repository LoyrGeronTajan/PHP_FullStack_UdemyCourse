  <h2>Pimento Cheese and Heirloom tomato Tart with Ritz Cracker Crust</h2>
  <h3><i>This could quite possibly be the best thing you make this summer.</i></h3>

  <br>

  <p>By <strong>Kelly Paige</strong></p>

  <p>Summer is here and that means it&#39s potluck season. Bring on the backyard barbecues, the rooftop soirees and the
    outdoor dinners. Whenever I&#39m invited to these events I always want to bring that one dish that wows the other
    guests. You want to hear people whispering, “What&#39s in this? Who made it? How do I get the recipe?” while they
    shove another forkful in their mouths.</p>

  <br>

  <p>Pasta salad is always a good choice to bring to these types of parties: It can be made ahead of time and tastes
    better the longer it sits. But there&#39s one problem ― it can be boring and flavorless. But good news: Making a
    stellar pasta salad only takes one simple ingredient you probably already have in the back of your fridge … pickle
    juice!</p>

  <p>Using the leftover brine from a jar of pickles isn&#39t a new phenomenon: It&#39s been used to marinate chicken,
    cure hangovers, add a zing to bloody marys and even relieve cramps in athletes. The juice and spices at the bottom
    of the jar are a delicious combination of vinegar, garlic, dill, mustard seeds, peppercorns and coriander seeds. It
    adds a brightness to dishes with a pop of acidity, sourness and tang. Think of it as a one-stop shop for flavor.</p>

  <p>In this recipe, the pickle juice cuts the richness of the mayo in a dill-heavy ranch dressing while adding a briny
    punch of flavor. The pasta salad also includes perfectly al dente noodles, a good measure of diced pickles, hunks of
    sharp cheddar cheese, fresh summer tomatoes and of course extra crispy thick-cut bacon. It&#39s basically all of
    your favorite foods combined into one dish and conveniently called a “salad.” The next time you&#39re looking to be
    the culinary superstar of the summer, look no further than a jar of pickles. The results will surprise you and your
    friends.</p>
